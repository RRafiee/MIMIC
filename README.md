# MIMIC (MInimal MethylatIon Classifier)

Rapid and reliable detection of DNA methylation signatures has major potential to advance disease diagnostics and underpin research investigations. We describe minimal methylation classifier (MIMIC), coupling CpG signature design, multiplex-PCR and mass-spectrometry to assess multi-locus DNA methylation signatures within routine clinically-applicable assays. Application of MIMIC to scant/low-quality samples from archival clinical trials cohorts, refractory to conventional genome-wide methylation analysis, revealed clinically-exploitable survival differences between the four methylation-defined medulloblastoma diagnostic subgroups.
